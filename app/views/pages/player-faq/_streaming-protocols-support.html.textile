SublimeVideo currently only supports videos delivered through HTTP. This is because HTTP is currently the only protocol consistently supported by HTML5 browsers.

SublimeVideo supports:

* "Progressive Download":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_download

* "HLS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming (although this is currently only supported in desktop Safari and Mobile Safari)

SublimeVideo does not support:

* "RTMP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol and "HDS":http://www.adobe.com/products/hds-dynamic-streaming.html (we may support these protocols in the future, however, this means our player would be forced to use Flash, because HTML5 doesn't – and will probably never – support these protocols)
