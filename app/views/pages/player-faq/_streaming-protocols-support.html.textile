SublimeVideo currently only supports videos delivered through HTTP. This is because HTTP is currently the only protocol consistently supported by HTML5 browsers.

We do support:

* "HLS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming (HTTP Live Streaming is only implemented in Safari and Mobile Safari)

We do not support:

* "RTMP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol support is something we plan to add in the future, however, this means our player would be forced into Flash mode, because HTML5 doesn't – and will probably never – support RTMP.
