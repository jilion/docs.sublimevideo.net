  h2. #{title('Returning to the initial state once video playback ends')}

  Sometimes you may want to return to the video's initial state – with the initial play button – once a video has finished playing. This is easy to achieve thanks to our "JavaScript API":/javascript-api.

  Simply put the following JavaScript code in a @<script>@ element just before the @</body>@ tag, or in an external file.

  bc(language-javascript). sublimevideo.ready(function() {
    sublimevideo.onEnd(function(sv) {
      sublimevideo.stop();
    });
  });

  *Note:* As discussed in the "Loop a video":/loop page, if you don’t want to apply this effect to all the videos in your page, you can add conditions before calling "(c)@sublimevideo.stop@":/javascript-api/methods#stop (for example adding an @id@ to your @<video>@ element and then perform a check on @sv.element.id@).

  h3(#demo). "Demo":#demo

  You can see this feature in action "on this page":http://test.sublimevideo.net/back-to-initial-state-on-end.
