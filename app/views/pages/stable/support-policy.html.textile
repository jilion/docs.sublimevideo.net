h3(#coverage). "Support coverage":#coverage

We can only support our own product: the SublimeVideo player and service. We will provide you with help regarding:

* installing SublimeVideo on your site,
* setting up your add-ons and players,
* generating proper @<video>@ elements.

We can not give general support about HTML, CSS, JavaScript or WordPress (for general WordPress support, please use the "WP.org":http://www.wordpress.org/support forums).

We can not provide support on 3rd party browser plugins nor 3rd party WordPress plugins (all 3rd party plugins should be disabled before contacting us for support).

h3(#bug-fixing). "Bug fixing":#bug-fixing

It is our commitment to fix any bugs as quickly as possible after they are brought to our attention. We will also try to provide a solution via our help desk for smaller bug fixes, after which we will update the player / service in our scheduled updates.
