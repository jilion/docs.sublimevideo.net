Since SublimeVideo is designed with HTML5 video in mind, just use @<!DOCTYPE html>@ before anything else at the top of your document. Do not place a comment line before the DOCTYPE declaration, or it will trigger IE to run in "Quirks Mode":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode.

Here is a valid example:

bc(language-markup). <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My website</title>
    <script src="//cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOUR_TOKEN.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content of your website -->
  </body>
</html>

*Make sure to replace _YOUR_TOKEN_ with your actual site's token (you can find it in the _<%= link_to "My sites", my_url('sites') %>_ page alongside your site's domain).*
