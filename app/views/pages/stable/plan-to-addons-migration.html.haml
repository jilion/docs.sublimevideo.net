  Because we have switched to an #{link_to '"Ã  la carte" pricing model', layout_url('pricing')}, registered users may be wondering how they are affected by the introduction of add-ons.

  Don't worry - certain add-ons have automatically been offered or activated, depending on your site's plan. As well as this, you get more for better value.

  Below are the migration details for each plan:

  h4. Changes common to all plans

  * All sites now benefit from *unlimited video plays*.
  * The free #{link_to "Forum & email support", layout_url('modular-player#support')} add-on is included for all sites.
  * Add-on prices are pro-rated by day so you only pay for the exact number of days you use a feature.
  * Invoices are issued and charged at the beginning of each month for the previous month (no more yearly billing period).

  h4. Users of the Free plan

  * No paid add-ons have been subscribed for your site.
  * *You still pay nothing.*

  h4. Users of the Trial plan

  * No paid add-ons have been subscribed for your site, since add-on subscription now starts automatically after the first 30 days.
  * *You still pay nothing.*

  h4. $9.90/month or $99/year Plus plan customers

  * *Unlimited video plays* instead of the previous 200,000 plays/month limit.
  * You've been subscribed to the #{link_to "No SublimeVideo logo", layout_url('modular-player#on_video_logo')} add-on: The SublimeVideo logo is removed from your videos' playback for $9.90/month.
