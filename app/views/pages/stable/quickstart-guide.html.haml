  Log into #{link_to "MySublimeVideo", my_url('sites')}, enter the domain of the site where you want to integrate SublimeVideo. This will generate a player that will only work on that site. For instance if you plan to have the player at _http://yourdomain.com/test/page.html_ you only need to enter _yourdomain.com_.

  *Notes:*
  * Your site's domain can be updated at any time.
  * You can share the same player across all your subdomains via the "wildcard option":/site-settings#wildcard.
  * You can share the same player across domains that are displaying or leading to the *same content* as your main domain via the "staging and alias domains option":/site-settings#staging-and-alias-domains.

  h3(#step-2). "Step 2: Embed the player's loader code":#step-2

  Copy the SublimeVideo Player's loader code for your site (by clicking the "Loader Code" button in the #{link_to "My sites", my_url('sites')} page) and paste it into the page where you plan to add your video(s). It's a single line of code (line 5) that will load the player you've created in the previous step.
  To ensure compatibility with old browsers that do not support HTML5, *we highly recommend you paste this line inside the @<head>@ tag[^"1":#fn-1^]*:

  <pre data-line=5><code class="language-markup"><!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My website</title>
      <script src="//cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOUR_TOKEN.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Content of your website -->
    </body>
  </html></code></pre>

  *Notes:*

  * *Make sure to replace _YOUR_TOKEN_ with your actual site's token (you can find it in the _#{link_to "My sites", my_url('sites')}_ page alongside your site's domain).*
  * If you have multiple videos on the same page, you only need to add this line once.

  h3(#step-3). "Step 3: Add videos":#step-3

  For every video you want to add to your page, you need a "proper @<video>@ tag":/write-proper-video-elements with the @class@ attribute set to _sublime_. When the page is loaded, the player will automatically look for all @<video>@ elements with the _sublime_ @class@ and take care of the rest.

  We *strongly recommend* using our "Video Publishing Assistant":/video-publishing-assistant to easily create properly configured @<video>@ elements that are automatically optimized for SublimeVideo. This is the easiest way to create @<video>@ elements for your site. Alternatively, you can manually write your own @<video>@ elements by following the instructions on "this page":/write-proper-video-elements#manually-configuring-video.

  Here is how your final @<video>@ element should look:

  bc(language-markup). <video class="sublime" width="640" height="360" poster="video-poster.jpg" preload="none">
    <source src="http://yoursite.com/video.mp4" />
    <source src="http://yoursite.com/video.webm" />
  </video>

  <div class="footnotes">
  #(#fn-1) If you want to put it elsewhere, please make sure it's before any @<video>@ element.
  </div>
