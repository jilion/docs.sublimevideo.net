h2. <%= title('Embed') %>

This add-on allows your audience to easily share your videos by embedding them into their own sites or elsewhere on the web. It displays an embed button on the top-right corner of the player which opens a pane with the actual embed code and the possibility to change the video embed size.

<%= image_tag('embed/embed_button.jpg', class: 'screenshot', title: 'Embed button') %>
_The main embed button in our <%= link_to "Classic", layout_url('modular-player#player_designs') %> player._

<%= image_tag('embed/embed_pane.jpg', class: 'screenshot', title: 'Embed pane') %>
_The embed pane._

h3(#setup). "Set up your embeds":#setup

There are two steps to achieve before enabling your videos to be embeddable:

# Create a specially-crafted HTML page with your video in it, this is the iframe content
# Configure the embed button: defines the embed URL and embed default size

h4(#iframe-content). "1. The iframe content":#iframe-content

In order for your video to be actually embeddable, you need to create an HTML page for every video you would like to make available for embedding. You need to host this page on one of the domains you have registered on <%= link_to "MySublimeVideo", my_url('sites') %>.

The final snippet of code that your audience will share is an @<iframe>@ element pointing to that HTML page.

bc(language-markup). <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOUR_TOKEN.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <video style="display:none" class="sublime">
    <source src="video.mp4" />
    <source src="video.webm" />
  </video>
</body>

*Important information:*

* Replace _YOUR_TOKEN_ with your actual site's token (you can find it in the _<%= link_to "My Sites", my_url('sites') %>_ page alongside your site's domain).
* Replace the @<video>@ element with the code generated by the "Video Publishing Assistant":/beta/video-publishing-assistant but change the following two things:
  - Don't specify the @width@ and @height@ attributes, the player will automatically fill the entire iframe.
  - Add @style="display:none"@. It's optional but we recommend it to prevent UI flickering upon iframe's initial load.

Host this file on a domain that is registered on <%= link_to "MySublimeVideo", my_url('sites') %>. For instance, if your registered domain is _yourdomain.com_, you could save this page at _http://yourdomain.com/embeds/video1.html_.

h4(#configure-options). "2. How to configure the different options":#configure-options

Like most of our add-ons, you can set up its default options that should apply to all of your videos from your site's Player editor page on <%= link_to "MySublimeVideo", my_url('sites') %>. But you can also set more options and override the default ones on a per video basis via the "Video Publishing Assistant":/beta/video-publishing-assistant, or manually, using the "data-settings":/beta/settings/usage attribute directly on the @<video>@ elements.

The table below gives you an overview of all the embed options available and from where you can actually set them up.
