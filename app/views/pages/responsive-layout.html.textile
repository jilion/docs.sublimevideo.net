SublimeVideo now comes with an integrated resizing feature so you only have to set one setting on your @<video>@ element and SublimeVideo takes care of the rest.

There are two ways to resize the video: @fit@ and @fill@.

With @fit@, the player will fit its parent without altering its aspect ratio. While with @fill@, the player will completely fill its parent, adjusting its aspect ratio when necessary.

To specify the autoresize behavior you'd like to use for your @<video>@, please use the "@autoresize@ player setting":settings/player-settings#autoresize.
