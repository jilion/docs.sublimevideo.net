h2. <%= title('Customize the start view') %>

The default start view ensures compatibility across all browsers (down to IE6). We strongly discourage you from modifying it using CSS.

h3. Customize or disable the initial overlay

To customize or disable the initial overlay, please use the "@initial-overlay-enable@ and @initial-overlay-visibility@ player settings":settings/player-settings#initial-overlay-enable.

h4(#demo-1). "Demo":#demo-1

<%= jsfiddle_embed('JpjXu', height: 390) %>

h3. Use a custom start view

You can also use your own custom start view using our "JavaScript API":javascript-api to start the video playback as soon as the user clicks on your new custom view.

In the example below we're using a simple @<div>@ placeholder as the custom start view.

h4(#demo-2). "Demo":#demo-2

<%= jsfiddle_embed('xM6Fv', height: 350, panes: 'result,html,js') %>

*Note:*

* Don't add the _sublime_ @class@ to the @<video>@ element since the video will be prepared through the JS API.
* Make sure you embed the jQuery library (you can find the latest version "here":http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery) in your page!
* Put the JavaScript code in a @<script>@ element just before the @</body>@ tag, or in an external file.
