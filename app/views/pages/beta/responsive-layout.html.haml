  SublimeVideo now comes with an integrated resizing feature so you only have to set one setting on your @<video>@ element and SublimeVideo takes care of the rest.

  To specify the autoresize behavior you'd like to use for your @<video>@, please use the "@autoresize@ player setting":settings/player-settings#autoresize.

-# h3(#autoresize). "@autoresize@":#autoresize

-# Resizes the video when its parent container is resized.

-# *Allowed values:*
-# * @none@ – _(Default)_ The player is not resized automatically.
-# * @fill@ – Fill the player's parent and stretch the player if necessary (resulting in letter/pillar-boxed video).
-# * @fit@ – Fit the player's to its parent without stretching the player itself (its size will always match the video's aspect-ratio and never shows black bars).

-# *Example:*

-# bc(language-markup). <video class='sublime' data-settings='autoresize:fill'>
-#   ...
-# </video>

-# *Note:* If you set this setting to @fill@ or @fit@, you can omit the @width@ and @height@ attributes in your @<video>@.
