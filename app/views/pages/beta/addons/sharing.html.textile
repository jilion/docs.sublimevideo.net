h2. <%= title('Social Sharing') %>

This add-on provides social sharing feature to your player. It displays a sharing button on the top-right corner of the player which opens a pane with different sharing options/services of your choice:

* Twitter
* Facebook
* Google+
* Pinterest
* Plain link sharing

<%= image_tag('sharing/sharing_button.png', class: 'screenshot', title: 'Sharing button') %>
_The main sharing button._

<%= image_tag('sharing/sharing_pane.png', class: 'screenshot', title: 'Sharing pane') %>
_The sharing pane complete with social sharing and link field._

Like most of our add-ons, you can set up its default options that should apply to all of your videos from your site's "Players" page on <%= link_to "MySublimeVideo", my_url('sites') %>. But you can also set more options and override the default ones on a per video basis via the "Video Publishing Assistant":/beta/video-publishing-assistant, or manually, using the "data-settings":/beta/settings/usage attribute directly on the @<video>@ elements.


h3(#sharing_url). "Properly linking to a video":#sharing_url

h3(#settings). "Settings":#settings

The table below gives you an overview of all the sharing options available and from where you can actually set them up.
