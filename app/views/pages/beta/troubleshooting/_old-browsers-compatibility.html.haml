  If you see JavaScript errors like @Object does not support this property or method@ or @'ob' is null or not an object@, it's likely that you've put your embed code _after_ a @<video>@ element in your page.
  To ensure compatibility with old browsers (mostly IE < 9) that do not support HTML5, *we highly recommend you put your embed code inside the @<head>@ tag*. If you want to put it elsewhere, please make sure it's before any @<video>@ element.
