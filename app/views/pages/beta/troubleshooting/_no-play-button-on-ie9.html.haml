  Since SublimeVideo is designed with HTML5 video in mind, just use @<!DOCTYPE html>@ before anything else at the top of your document. Do not place a comment line before the DOCTYPE declaration, or it will trigger IE to run in "Quirks Mode":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode.

  Here is a valid example:

  bc(language-markup). <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My website</title>
      <script src="//cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOUR_TOKEN.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Content of your website -->
    </body>
  </html>
