h3. What does the acquisition of Jilion mean for the SublimeVideo player service?

The SublimeVideo service continues to be operated for the time being and your videos will continue to play.

All the add-ons are now free for everyone. The Statistics add-on is only available to users that were already subscribed to it.

Any possible change affecting the service will be communicated to SublimeVideo's users in advance.

No new feature is planned at the moment and any future plans will be communicated at a later stage.

Please stay tuned on this page for up-to-date information.
