h3. We are closing.

With the release of dailymotion’s new video player, based on SublimeVideo technology, the framework is integrated into dailymotion’s services. Our primary goal is to make the dailymotion video viewing experience the best in the world and the new player focuses on performance, customizability and accessibility.

As part of this release we are closing the SublimeVideo services and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all users for their support and for using SublimeVideo.

You can already now try the public beta of the HTML5 Player here: "http://www.dailymotion.com/player":http://www.dailymotion.com/player

The final release of the new player (HTML5 and Flash versions) is planned in April.

We are inviting you to join the "Dailymotion Partner Program":http://official.dailymotion.com to get access to the player and other powerful features, including live encoding and recording, advanced audience and revenue statistics, video editing tools, and much more.

Sign-up for new users will be closed today. For current users the SublimeVideo services will continue to operate until *September 12th 2015*. At this date all services, the player and MySublimeVideo back-office, *will be closed*.
