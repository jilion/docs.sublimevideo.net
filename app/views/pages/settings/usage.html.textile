%(red)Please note that most of the settings described in this page can be set via the "Video Publishing Assistant":/video-publishing-assistant and via your site's Player editor page on <%= link_to "MySublimeVideo", my_url('sites') %>.%

Data settings are settings that you add to a DOM element (before being prepared by the SublimeVideo application) in order to alter it's behaviour once prepared. You can write data settings in two ways

h4. Via @data-@_@setting-name@_ attributes

Each setting can be set via a @data-@ attribute on the DOM element.

For instance:

bc(language-markup). <video data-autoresize="fit" data-on-end="stop" ...>

h4. Via the @data-settings@ attribute

If you have multiple settings to specify, you can also group them in a single @data-settings@ attribute, as a CSS-like formatted string.

For instance:

bc(language-markup). <video data-settings="autoresize: fit; on-end: stop;" ...>

h3. Supported Settings

See "(c)Player settings":player-settings for the list of supported settings you can put on your @<video>@ elements, and "(c)Lightbox settings":lightbox-settings for the list settings supported on the @<a>@ elements that trigger the lightbox.
